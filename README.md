# SQL Challenge README

## Overview
This repository contains SQL code for creating tables and performing data analysis on a sample employee database.

## Table of Contents
1. [Table Schema](#table-schema)
2. [Data Analysis](#data-analysis)

## Table Schema
The SQL script `schema.sql` contains the schema for the following tables:
- `departments`
- `titles`
- `employees`
- `dept_manager`
- `salaries`
- `dept_emp`

## Data Analysis
The SQL script `data_analysis.sql` contains the following queries:

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

## Usage
- Execute `schema.sql` to create the required tables.
- Execute `data_analysis.sql` to perform data analysis.

## Note
Ensure to set the datestyle appropriately before executing the scripts.
